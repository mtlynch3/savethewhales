        <h3 class="about-item" style="margin-left: 20px;">
          "Cetaceans" is a collective term that includes the aquatic mammals: whales, dolphins and porpoises. There are two types of cetaceans: those with
          <span class="emphasis">teeth</span>
          and those with
          <span class="emphasis">baleen.</span>
        </h3>
        <div class="about-item">
          <br>
          <p>The order Cetacea is divided into three subgroups:</p>
          <ol style="padding:20px">
            <li>The Odontoceti or "toothed whales," including 65 or more living species of dolphins, porpoises and whales (sperm whales, belugas, narwhals and beaked whales). All of these species have teeth.</li>

            <li>The Mysticeti or "moustached whales" includes ten living species of baleen whales including the magnificent blue whale -- the largest animal on earth at 100 feet -- fin, humpback, right, minke and gray whales. Instead of teeth, baleen whales have a series of plates that grow down from the roof of the whale's mouth. Baleen is made of keratin, a material similar to human fingernails and resembles the frayed teeth of a comb. The outer edge of baleen is smooth, while the inner edge is bristly to hairlike in structure. This unique structure allows the whales to act as giant filter feeders. When the whale gulps a mouthful of seawater, the baleen traps small ocean crustaceans. The whale then closes its mouth and spits out the excess water, leaving filtered food of small animals stuck in the baleen. Using its large tongue, the whale then scoops off food from the inside of its mouth and swallows it.</li>
